### Connecting influxdb to binance


### Steps
 - Fill the configuration file (connection_config.yml) with your data.
 - set the PYTHONPATH to the code folder: (i.e. export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/diego/Desktop/crypto/my_github/binance_quantitative_trading/code)
 - run the file **populate_and_connect.py**
 
If the set-up is correct your influxdb should connect with binance after populating with past data.
